## 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

### Background Context
This project is meant to be done by groups of two students. Each group of two should pair program for at least the mandatory part.



### Resources 
Read or watch:

* Sorting algorithm
* Big O notation
* Sorting algorithms animations
* 15 sorting algorithms in 6 minutes (WARNING: The following video can trigger seizure/epilepsy. It is not required for the project, as it is only a funny visualization of different sorting algorithms)CS50 Algorithms explanation in detail by David Malan
* All about sorting algorithms

### 0. Bubble sort
* write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm

### 1. Insertion sort
* Write a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm
